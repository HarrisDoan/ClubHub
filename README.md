## Overview

ClubHub is a web platform exclusively for UCLA students. 

We help students find clubs based on their interests and provide a rating and review system for better decision-making. Discover the perfect club at UCLA with ClubHub!

## Features

### 1. Get Matched with clubs that best fit you

Our website matches and recommends clubs to you based on your current interests and favorite clubs.

### 2. Share your experiences

Recommend the best clubs to join or criticize why you didn't enjoy them. You can choose to be anonymous: our app does not expose the email you used to sign up but instead uses your major and year.

### 3. Analyze each club in depth

We strive to make our service a one-stop destination for everything UCLA clubs. It periodically monitors UCLA's official club api and tells you the newest information(how to join, requirements, etc) of each club. You can even search for clubs based on interests and rating.
